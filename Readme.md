Description:

This repository serves as the foundation for my laboratory work in the Text Analytics course (Semester 2, Academic Year 2023/2024). It explores the domain of text analytics, aiming to extract meaningful insights and patterns from unstructured textual data. As a crucial component of the digital age, text analytics equips us with the ability to harness the power of vast amounts of text-based information for informed decision-making.
